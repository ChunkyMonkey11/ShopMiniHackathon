The idea for this shop mini is a platform. Where I can view the products my friends are buying.
I can also see the products I like but on the top of the page I can just scroll through and select from my friends what
their feed is showing them. Then when I press on lets say Roman. The feed gets refreshed
With what roman is buying and the products he likes.

I can invite friends to let me see their feed and them seeing mine.

The idea is since everyone has a unique curated feed. Lets say my friends have good clothing style
I can hop onto their feed and see what products they get reccomended.
