- user_id (TEXT, Foreign Key to user_profiles)
- product_id (TEXT)
- product_data (JSONB)
- share_message (TEXT, optional)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- is_active (BOOLEAN)
```

### `item_votes` table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- shared_item_id (UUID, Foreign Key to shared_items)
- voter_id (TEXT, Foreign Key to user_profiles)
- vote_type (TEXT, 'like' or 'dislike')
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- UNIQUE(shared_item_id, voter_id)
```

## User Flow

### Sharing an Item
1. User navigates to their saved products (UserFeed)
2. Clicks share button (üì§) on any product card
3. Modal opens with product preview and message field
4. User adds optional message and clicks "Share Item"
5. Item appears in community voting feed

### Voting on Items
1. User clicks voting bubble (üó≥Ô∏è) on home screen
2. Sees feed of shared items from other users
3. Can filter by "Trending" or "Recent"
4. Clicks like/dislike buttons to vote
5. Vote counts update in real-time

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React state for UI interactions
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Real-time database queries for vote counts

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Users can only vote once per item
- Users can only delete their own shares
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with indexes
- Lazy loading of images
- Debounced vote submissions
- Pagination ready for large datasets
